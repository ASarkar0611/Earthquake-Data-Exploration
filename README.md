 Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/warcoder/earthquake-dataset
 
 This repository contains data preprocessing and visualization using python libraries like PySpark, Matplotlib, Seaborn. In the dbc file, the visualization has been done after cleaning and preprocessing the data. Also, data visualization is done in Tableau on the original data downloaded from Kaggle URL. The same has been published in my Tableau public account. Click on the below link to view the same.
